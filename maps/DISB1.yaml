# Semantic Map - Stores from Knowledge Graph
# Notes on store poses and gotoposes:
# - 'pose' defines the center of the store's representative volume.
# - 'size' defines approximate dimensions [size_x, size_y, size_z].
#   - For stores in vertical (N/S) corridor alcoves (on the West): size_x is depth, size_y is width along corridor.
#   - For stores off horizontal (E/W) corridors: size_x is width, size_y is depth from corridor.
# - 'gotopose' is a navigation target for the robot, usually in the corridor facing the store's entrance.
#   - Yaw for gotopose: 0 (East), 90 (North), 180 (West), -90 (South).
